# Weather App

This is a simple weather application that fetches real-time weather data for a city using the OpenWeatherMap API. The user can enter a city name, and the app will display the current temperature, humidity, weather description, and an emoji representing the weather condition.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- OpenWeatherMap API
- HTML & CSS

## Features
- Fetches real-time weather data based on the city name entered by the user.
- Displays temperature (in Celsius), humidity, weather description, and an emoji representing the weather condition.
- Error handling for invalid city names or network issues.


## Project Purpose
This project was created as part of an online course to practice working with asynchronous JavaScript (using `async`/`await`) and fetching data from an external API.
